# CAN_CO - CAN corruption device

## What CAN_CO is?

CAN_CO is a programmable device, which is capable to corrupt CAN communication frames, thus enables testing systems in the presence of communication errors.

CAN_CO is a low cost device. The employed hardware provide limited operational capabilities.

Frames corrupted on mostly statistical basis, full deterministic operation can not be guaranteed.

## What CAN_CO isn't?

CAN_CO is not a full blown failure generator system.

CAN_CO is a **non**deterministic failure generator.
